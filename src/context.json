  "bio": " Everyone knows about MySpace and its endless customization options through CSS. As a 9 year-old, I didn't know anything about CSS so I copy pasted some template from the internet. I then played with the CSS to get exactly what I wanted. After that, came <b>YouTube</b> and its customization. My explorations went everywhere throughout the years. But one things is for certain, since 2010, I would always go back to coding, even if it was for a single day. <br /><br /> I have ventured in web development, game development, <b>mobile development</b>, but the niche that I am best suited for is backend development. <br /><br /> I am a software engineer in the cloud by trade, but also like to do <b>photography</b> in my spare time, or torture myself by playing <b>soulsborne</b> games for hours on end.",
